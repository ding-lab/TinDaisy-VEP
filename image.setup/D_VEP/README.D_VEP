# This is important for performance reasons.  However, should be able to test VEP without it.

# See also here for how to install cache separately in a docker environment: https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/script/vep_download.html#docker
# See here for discussion of caches: https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/script/vep_cache.html
